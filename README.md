Hi,

This is the fifth project that i did as part of my training to become web developer. The project was about learning and using JavaScript for backend.

If you watch it, first of all thank you ! And feel free to contact me about some part of the code ;)

To launch the project you will have to do 3 things :
- Open a console, go to the main folder and type "npm start"
- Open another console, go to the folder backend and type "node server"
- After this two steps go to this adress `http://localhost:4200/` 
Everything should work ;)

I wish you a nice day or evening,

Thibault
